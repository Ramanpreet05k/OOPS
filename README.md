# Step 1 : Java Basics

#### **JAVA**

- Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
- It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

#### **Sample Code**

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

#### **Understanding the Parts:**

- class Main: Everything in Java happens inside a class. We define a class named "Main". Ideally, the file name should also be Main.java.

- public static void main(String[] args): This is the entry point.
- public: Access modifier, means it can be accessed from anywhere.
- static: It can be run without creating an object of the class.
- void: It does not return any value.
- main: The name of the method.
- String[] args: Command line arguments. We can pass inputs to the program when running it from the command line.

- System.out.println: The command to print output to the screen. println means "print line", so it moves to a new line after printing.



#### **Operators**


#### 1.Arithmetic Operators
- + (Addition): Adds two values.
- - (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left.
- * (Multiplication): Multiplies two values.
- / (Division): Divides the left operand by the right.
- % (Modulo): Returns the remainder of a division operation.


#### 2.Unary Operators
Operators that require only one operand.

- ++ (Increment): Increases a value by 1.
- -- (Decrement): Decreases a value by 1.
- ! (Logical NOT): Inverts the boolean value.


#### 3.Relational Operators
Used to compare two values. They return a boolean result (true or false).

- == (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
- != (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
- > (Greater than): Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
- < (Less than): Checks if the left value is less than the right.
- >= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.
- <= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.


#### 4.Logical Operators
Used to determine the logic between variables or values.

- && (Logical AND): Returns true if both statements are true.
- || (Logical OR): Returns true if at least one of the statements is true.


#### 5.Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

- = (Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
- += (Add and Assign): Adds a value to the variable and assigns the result.
- -= (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts a value from the variable and assigns the result.
- *= (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns the result.
- /= (Divide and Assign): Divides the variable by a value and assigns the result.
- %= (Modulo and Assign): Assigns the remainder of the division to the variable.
